# Challenge: Is Des Moines, IA A Good Location For A Bike Rental Business?

Used the Citi Bike Trip Data, a bike rental business in New York City, as a starting place, to create a story to support a bike rental business in Des Moines, IA. 

  - I started by comparing the number of McDonalds in both cities as that is an indicator of local spend.  Researched data on the two cities to find the correlation between the number of McDonalds stores, local retail sales per capita and population growth. The number of McDonalds is a key indicator because they only build stores where there is a “high local spend” (fastcompany.com).  I found that despite Des Moines being smaller in population and geography it has almost as many stores as New York City.
  
   - I researched how much people in Des Moines spend locally in relationship to their income and found that the local retail sales per capita was a higher percentage of their income per capita than in New York City.
   
  - I researched the population growth of each city. The population growth rate in Des Moines is faster than in New York City. That indicates there will be more people to spend locally. 
  
  - Last, I researched the cost of doing business in the two cities.  I found the cost of doing business in Des Moines is lower than in New York City.  
  
  - The combination of the larger population growth and the increased local spend per capita in Des Moines make it a great location for a bike rental business.
